# Value Proposition: Django Forms Workflows vs Alternatives

## Executive Summary

Django Forms Workflows fills a critical gap in the Django ecosystem by providing **enterprise-grade form management** with **approval workflows** and **external data integration** - features typically only found in expensive SaaS solutions.

## The Problem

Organizations using Django face a common dilemma when building forms:

### Option 1: Code Every Form (Crispy Forms, Django Forms)
**Pros:**
- Full control

- ❌ Requires developer for every form change
- ❌ Deployment needed for new forms
- ❌ No built-in approval workflows
- ❌ No external data integration
- ❌ No audit trail
- ❌ Business users can't create forms

### Option 2: Use SaaS Form Builders (JotForm, Formstack, Typeform)
**Pros:**
- No-code form creation
- Built-in workflows
- Nice UI

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive ($50-500/month)
- ❌ Data stored externally
- ❌ Limited LDAP integration
- ❌ Can't query internal databases
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Compliance concerns

### Option 3: Build Custom Solution
**Pros:**
- Tailored to needs
- Full control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Months of development time
- ❌ Ongoing maintenance burden
- ❌ Reinventing the wheel
- ❌ Opportunity cost

## The Solution: Django Forms Workflows
